1. You started at 0, pressed Ignite 7 times, moved the slider to 52, then pressed Decrement twice. What exact value and color status did your app show at each step?

Step 1 shows 7 with an orange color, step 2 shows 52 with a green color, step 3 shows 50 with and orange color.

2. Describe exactly what happened in your app when you attempted to go below 0 and above 100. What logic in your code prevented invalid values?

Nothing happens because I added logic that if the _counter was below 1 then it equals 0 and if it is above 99 then it equals 100. It can't go past those values.

3. At what exact action did your app switch from numeric display to "LIFTOFF!"? Explain how your condition check works and why it triggers at that point.

It triggered as soon as the _counter passed 99 because I added logic in my build widget that has a conditional that _counter is either equal to 100 and displaying liftoff or equal to _counter.
